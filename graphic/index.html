    <h1>Graphic Design in Cold War</h1>
    <hr class="thin-hr">
    <h2>During the Cold War, graphic design played a pivotal role in propaganda, serving as a tool for shaping political narratives and influencing public opinion. Posters produced by the United States and the Soviet Union emphasized contrasting ideologies, promoting concepts such as freedom and democracy versus communism and collectivism. These propaganda posters reflected the societal tensions of the era, actively contributing to the ideological struggle between the two superpowers.</h2>

        This topic important not only for me but also to the field/industry.
        <br>
        Because planning future designs by knowing the history of design and what influences it has had is essential.
        <br>
        However, we plan to hold the exhibition as an online exhibition with improved accessibility and no space restrictions.
        <br>Knowing the role that design plays in the process of forming value and delivering and consuming it in design history allows us to understand the concept of more diverse structures.
